**Production Line Tracker README**
By Christian McCann

This is a project that is designed to help a media player production facility keep track of the products that they produce.

**Sprint 1:**
Currently this project connects to a database allowing users to insert products.

**Sprint 2:**
This Project has not progressed further into databases, but each tab of the program has functionality and the next step is to integrate the database.

**Sprint 3:**
This project now fully works as designed. Products can be added to the database, and Production logs can be generated and saved to the database. This program also includes a tab to generate employee usernames and emails. This tab also checks password requirements.

**Diagrams:**

Class and Database diagrams can be found as PNG files in this repo.
